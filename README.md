# Focal Persistence and Phylodynamics of Heartland Virus in Georgia

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and analyses used in the academic paper titled "Focal Persistence and Phylodynamics of Heartland Virus in Georgia". The study investigates the epidemiological and molecular dynamics of Heartland Virus (HRTV), a segmented tick-borne bunyavirus, in the state of Georgia, USA. Our research focuses on understanding the virusâ€™s persistence in host populations, its genetic evolution, and the factors influencing its transmission dynamics.

This repository is part of an ongoing project that utilizes Path Sampling (NS) model selection, Bayesian Evaluation of Temporal Signal (BETS), Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, and phylogenetic analyses to unravel the mechanisms driving the spread and persistence of the HRTV in Georgia's ecosystem.

To conduct model selection and BETS analyses we constructed XML files in BEUATi 2 (v2.7.7) using the PS model selection method. The Optimized Relaxed Clock (referred to as ORC in the Folder/file names) molecular clock were used for testing the Coalescent Constant Population (CCP), Bayesian Skyline (BS) and Extended Bayesian Skyline (EBS) demographic models. For more information on the parameters used to in this study for the model BETS (S4 BETS analysis) and model selection (S5 Model testing) please refer to the following attachments.
